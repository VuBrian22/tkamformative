This site was built on BootStrap 4 and its librabries. The purpose was for an English 2P Assignment that analyzes a character in the story "To Kill a Mocking Bird" by Harper Lee. I felt fancy and wanted to incorporate technology a bit more than my peers did, which probably made a simple Google Doc implementation on the assignment.
